# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS: The enhanced confidence variation system is implemented but not functioning - the robust confidence calculation still produces identical results despite varying market inputs.

KEY ACHIEVEMENTS: (1) ✅ IA2 Confidence Display - Dashboard shows 76.0% average confidence (dramatic improvement from old 37.3%), individual decisions consistently show 76.0% confidence with 50% minimum strictly enforced, (2) ✅ IA2 Reasoning Quality - All decisions display comprehensive analysis with detailed market assessment, data validation, and risk controls (1500+ character reasoning), (3) ✅ Trading Signal Distribution - Performance tab shows 100% HOLD signals (8 HOLD, 0 LONG, 0 SHORT) as expected with conservative thresholds working correctly, (4) ✅ Performance Metrics - Performance tab displays 'Avg IA2 Confidence: 76.0%' confirming the robust system is operational, (5) ✅ Real-time Updates - Fresh decisions being generated with robust confidence through WebSocket connectivity, (6) ✅ UI Quality - All IA2 improvements are clearly visible and accessible to users across all tabs. CONCLUSION: The frontend successfully displays the SUCCESSFUL IA2 robust confidence system improvements. Users can now see the dramatic improvement from 37.3% to 76% confidence, quality reasoning, conservative trading approach (100% HOLD as designed), and real-time updates with robust confidence. The system operates correctly within the designed 50-95% confidence bounds with 0 violations of the 50% minimum."

    - message: "🔍 BINGX BALANCE AND IA2 CONFIDENCE DEBUG INVESTIGATION COMPLETED: Comprehensive testing reveals TWO CRITICAL ISSUES: (1) ❌ BINGX BALANCE ISSUE CONFIRMED - Balance shows $0.00 USDT instead of expected $11+. ROOT CAUSE: BingX API connectivity failure (status: False), empty account_balances array. API authentication working (orders endpoint accessible) but balance retrieval failing. LIKELY CAUSES: API keys for spot trading not futures, insufficient permissions for balance queries, account configuration issues. (2) ❌ IA2 CONFIDENCE UNIFORMITY ISSUE CONFIRMED - ALL 8 decisions show exactly 76% confidence (0.000 range). ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: Limited opportunity data_confidence variation (only 2 unique values with 0.050 range) + uniform MACD signals (all 0.000) causing identical IA2 calculations despite varying IA1 inputs. IA1 analysis_confidence varies properly (7 unique values, 0.280 range). RECOMMENDATIONS: (1) Check BingX API key permissions for futures trading access, (2) Investigate why opportunity data_confidence has minimal variation, (3) Debug MACD calculation returning uniform zero values across symbols."

    - message: "🎯 BINGX BALANCE AND IA2 CONFIDENCE VARIATION FIXES TESTING COMPLETED: Comprehensive validation of the requested fixes shows MIXED RESULTS. FINDINGS: (1) ❌ BINGX BALANCE FIX NOT WORKING - Enhanced balance retrieval with fallback handling not properly integrated into API endpoints. Market status does not contain 'bingx_balance' field, no $100 fallback visible, enhanced logging missing. (2) ❌ IA2 CONFIDENCE VARIATION FIX NOT WORKING - ALL 8 decisions still show exactly 76% confidence (0.000 range). Enhanced quality scoring system has issues: MACD signals all 0.000, all analyses single data source, symbol-based variation not working. (3) ✅ 50% CONFIDENCE MINIMUM WORKING - All decisions maintain ≥50% confidence as required, reasoning quality 100%. (4) ❌ ENHANCED QUALITY SCORING PARTIAL - RSI variation working (46.70 range), but MACD and multi-source bonuses not working. CRITICAL ISSUES: The enhanced confidence variation system is not creating realistic distribution because MACD calculations return uniform zeros and multi-source data aggregation is not working. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent needs to fix MACD calculation logic, implement proper multi-source data handling, debug symbol-based variation, and ensure enhanced balance retrieval is properly exposed through API endpoints."

    - message: "🎯 COMPREHENSIVE FIXES TESTING COMPLETED FOR BINGX BALANCE AND IA2 CONFIDENCE VARIATION: Extensive testing of the comprehensive fixes reveals CRITICAL ISSUES PERSIST. FINDINGS: (1) ❌ BINGX OFFICIAL API BALANCE INTEGRATION FAILED - Enhanced _get_account_balance() method not properly integrated into market-status endpoint, no 'bingx_balance' field present, BingX API shows 'SwapPerpetualAPI' object has no attribute 'account' errors, connectivity test failing with 'Asynchronous session is not initialized', no $100 fallback mechanism visible, (2) ❌ IA2 CONFIDENCE REAL VARIATION FAILED - ALL 8 decisions still show exactly 0.760 (76%) confidence with 0.000 range across different symbols (TELUSDT, PUMPUSDT, ENAUSDT, etc.), no symbol-based variation despite enhanced quality scoring, cache clear endpoint missing (405 Method Not Allowed), (3) ✅ ENHANCED QUALITY SCORING PARTIAL SUCCESS - RSI analysis (62.5%) and MACD analysis (50%) detected in reasoning, but confidence variation not working, (4) ✅ 50% MINIMUM CONFIDENCE MAINTAINED - All decisions maintain ≥50% confidence as required. ROOT CAUSE: The comprehensive fixes are implemented but not properly integrated - BingX balance retrieval not exposed through API endpoints, IA2 confidence calculation still overrides market-driven variations. RECOMMENDATION: Main agent needs to properly integrate enhanced balance retrieval into market-status endpoint, fix BingX API object issues, implement cache clear endpoint, and debug confidence calculation to ensure market variations affect final confidence values."
