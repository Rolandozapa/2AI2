<analysis>
The trajectory outlines the evolution of a Dual AI Trading Bot. Initially, the AI addressed a  integration, ensuring only tradable symbols were scouted, including fixing hyphenated symbol matching. A major effort was then dedicated to reactivating and refining the Python-based Multi-RR Decision Engine, which GPT-4o was incorrectly expected to handle, integrating its sophisticated calculations and display into IA1's analysis, including a post-calculation reflection sentiment. Subsequently, numerous scout admission filters (TOP N cryptos, R:R pre-filter, volume, market cap, professional filters) were progressively relaxed to increase opportunity diversity. Finally, the restrictive IA2 filter, which previously relied solely on a 2.0 RR threshold, was replaced with a more intelligent 5-criterion probabilistic logic. The trajectory concluded with the user requesting IA2 to implement on-measure Take Profit levels with probabilistic distributions.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build an Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot using React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), and MongoDB (database). It employs a market scout, IA1 (GPT-4o) for technical analysis, and IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet) for strategic decisions, leveraging multi-source market data and controlling BingX Futures. Key features include dynamic TP/SL, position inversion, dynamic leverage, and granular AI credit control.

Recent enhancements focus on:
- Robust data aggregation and deduplication.
- Confidence-based IA1-IA2 filtering.
- Multi-level TP strategies (now evolving to probabilistic).
- Accurate technical indicator calculation for micro-priced tokens.
- Relaxing scout filters (e.g., from TOP 25 to TOP 50, removing R:R pre-filter, lowering volume/market cap thresholds) to increase opportunity diversity and include small caps, while ensuring BingX tradability.
- Reactivating and enhancing a Python-based Multi-RR Decision Engine for IA1, displaying actual Risk-Reward ratios and a post-calculation reflection sentiment.
- Replacing the simple  IA2 admission filter with a more intelligent, multi-criteria (confidence, master pattern, expected value) probabilistic logic.

<code_architecture>


-   : The core FastAPI application, orchestrating the trading system.
    -   **Importance**: Handles market data, AI analysis (IA1/IA2), trading, and WebSockets. It contains the  class and various filtering/analysis methods.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Initialization of  at startup for tradable symbols.
        -   Reactivation and refinement of the Python-based Multi-RR Decision Engine logic.
        -   Enhancements to IA1's prompt and parsing logic to integrate full JSON analysis, , and a post-calculation reflection sentiment alongside Multi-RR results.
        -   Removal of the restrictive lateral movement filter and the Scout R:R pre-filter.
        -   Expansion of  from TOP 25 to TOP 50.
        -   Reduction of minimum volume and market cap thresholds in scouting and momentum filters.
        -   Complete removal of  function.
        -   Simplification of  overrides from 7 complex rules to 3 concise ones (Strong Signal, Premium Data, Tradable).
        -   Replacement of the single RR < 2.0 IA2 admission filter with a 5-criteria probabilistic logic (high confidence, Multi-RR resolved, Master Pattern, significant movement, expected value).
        -   Multiple debugging iterations to ensure IA1's full JSON output (analysis, reasoning, technical signals) is correctly parsed and passed through the system.

-   : Contains the  class.
    -   **Importance**: Fetches, filters, and caches tradable futures symbols from BingX.
    -   **Changes Made**: The  method was updated to handle variations in BingX symbol naming conventions (e.g.,  vs ).

-   : Detects chart patterns.
    -   **Importance**: Used by the  for pre-filtering opportunities.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct changes to its core logic, but its integration was part of ensuring the existing technical validation was used instead of adding redundant logic.

<pending_tasks>
- Design and implement a probabilistic optimal TP system for IA2 to generate on-measure Take Profit levels with corresponding calibrated distributions.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with enhancing IA2's Take Profit (TP) strategy. The user requested to modify IA2's settings to generate on-measure TP levels with corresponding probabilistically calibrated optimal gain distributions.

The AI acknowledged that IA2 already has an advanced TP structure. The current work involved planning how to integrate this new, more sophisticated, probabilistic TP system. The trajectory ended after the AI outlined its plan for this probabilistic optimal TP system and was about to initiate the testing of this new feature. The core idea is to move beyond fixed TP levels to dynamically calculated ones based on market conditions and probabilistic outcomes.
