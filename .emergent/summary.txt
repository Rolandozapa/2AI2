<analysis>
The trajectory chronicles the AI engineer's intensive work on the Dual AI Trading Bot. Initially, the focus was on debugging frontend display issues for IA1 analyses, which was resolved by ensuring the backend trading system was running. This quickly escalated into fixing several critical backend bugs: an uninitialized  in IA2, a mislocated  method, incorrect  signature, and a  constructor bug.

Beyond fixes, significant features were implemented: IA2 now recalculates Risk-Reward (RR) based on its own technical levels, a sophisticated multi-timeframe analysis system was added to IA1 for chartist maturity with weighted penalties for counter-trend signals, and a comprehensive final scoring formula was integrated for IA1. Recurring themes included troubleshooting server overload (often due to infinite recursion) and data consistency (e.g., RR=0, incorrect MongoDB name). The current state sees the frontend responding, indicating backend stability after fixing an infinite recursion in the scoring formula and issues with RR calculation.

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot is a full-stack application using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, integrating GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic trading on BingX Futures. The core problem is automating sophisticated trading decisions based on comprehensive market data and AI insights.

Key requirements and implemented features include:
-   **Dual AI Decision Flow**: IA1 (technical analysis, >70% confidence) feeds IA2 (strategic review, >80% confidence). IA1 analyses pass to IA2 if LONG/SHORT + Conf > 70% OR RR >= 2.0.
-   **Comprehensive Technical Analysis**: IA1 incorporates chart patterns, RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, Fibonacci retracement, and extensive historical context.
-   **Adaptive Context System**: Dynamically adjusts strategies based on market conditions and 8 granular market phases.
-   **Dynamic Risk-Reward (RR)**: IA1 calculates realistic RR. IA2 can now recalculate RR using its own fresh technical levels and IA1's methodology.
-   **Multi-Timeframe Chartist Maturity**: IA1 performs regressive multi-timeframe analysis (1D > 4H > 1H) to identify dominant chart patterns, apply weighted penalties for counter-trend signals, and validate legitimate reversals.
-   **Sophisticated Final Scoring**: A formula applies market/token-specific bonus/malus to IA1's confidence, considering factors like volatility, volume, Fear & Greed index, RR quality, and market cap buckets.
-   **Frontend Display**: All AI analyses and decisions are displayed without truncation, with correct API routing.

-   **Risk-Reward Calculation**: Both directional and sophisticated neutral/composite methods.
-   **Weighted Scoring/Penalty System**: Dynamic adjustment of confidence based on multiple market factors.

<pending_tasks>
-   The server is now responding to frontend requests, but the complete end-to-end functionality (IA1 processing with new scoring, IA1->IA2 pipeline, IA2 decision-making with sophisticated RR) needs to be fully validated through a trading cycle.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was addressing persistent backend server blocking and high CPU usage issues. After several attempts, the  identified an infinite recursive call at line 6418 in , specifically within a  definition used in the new sophisticated scoring formula (). This was causing the server to overload and become unresponsive.

The fix involved correcting this lambda expression to properly call  without recursion. Additionally, an issue where IA1's Risk-Reward (RR) calculation consistently returned 0 was addressed by adding a fallback RR calculation logic that uses IA2's more robust  and  formulas if IA1's JSON response lacks . Another fix involved temporarily replacing a problematic call to  with a hardcoded  multiplier in the scoring formula.

The last reported action was the frontend successfully responding to requests after these fixes, indicating the backend is now starting up correctly. The system's full operational status, particularly the end-to-end trading cycle and the correct application of all new features (sophisticated scoring, multi-timeframe analysis, dynamic RR), still requires complete validation.
