The AI engineer's work primarily focused on integrating the Dual AI Trading Bot with the BingX Futures API. This involved several key phases: initially addressing user queries about app IP, collecting BingX API credentials, and then proceeding with backend and frontend development. The core implementation steps included creating , adding new FastAPI endpoints to , integrating trade execution logic into IA2's decision-making, and building a corresponding UI tab in . A major challenge throughout was debugging the BingX API's HMAC-SHA256 signature, particularly for POST requests. The agent successfully resolved IP whitelist issues, confirmed core trading logic (RR, position size, leverage, TP/SL), and established that the backend BingX integration for GET requests worked. The immediate problem is a Null signature error for POST requests due to incorrect parameter handling (sending parameters in JSON body instead of URL query string).

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot is a full-stack application designed for automated, sophisticated trading decisions on BingX Futures. It leverages GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic trading. The system requires a dual AI pipeline: if IA1 confidence exceeds 70% or Risk-Reward (RR) is >= 2.0, it feeds into IA2, which then needs over 80% confidence. Key functionalities include comprehensive technical analysis, an adaptive context system, dynamic RR calculation (IA1 calculates, IA2 re-calculates based on final adjusted prices), multi-timeframe chartist maturity, and an untruncated frontend display. The recent development focuses on robust BingX API integration to enable real-time trade execution based on IA2's decisions, including dynamic position sizing, leverage, and proper TP/SL configuration, while ensuring backend stability and accurate RR calculations.

<pending_tasks>
- Debug the HMAC-SHA256 signature for BingX API POST requests. The primary issue is sending parameters in the JSON body instead of the URL query string, as required by BingX for POST requests.
- Ensure the frontend correctly fetches and displays the real-time BingX balance (addressing the local vs. production URL issue if it resurfaces).

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was actively debugging the BingX API's HMAC-SHA256 signature for POST requests. Despite multiple attempts to correct the signature generation logic within  and verifying GET requests were functional, POST requests consistently failed with Signature verification failed or Null signature errors. The AI engineer, after reviewing official BingX documentation and external examples, discovered a crucial architectural mismatch: BingX requires *all* parameters for POST requests to be included in the URL's query string and *not* in the JSON request body. The current state is that this fundamental error has been identified, and the next step is to refactor the  and potentially other methods in  to construct POST requests with all parameters correctly placed in the query string for signature generation and API calls.
