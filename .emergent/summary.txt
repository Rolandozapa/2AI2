The AI engineer's work in this trajectory systematically enhanced a Dual AI Trading Bot. Initially, the focus was on implementing a robust historical data fallback system and verifying the IA1 to IA2 data flow. Key challenges included an initial issue where IA2 wasn't receiving IA1 analyses due to an overly restrictive filter and an exhausted LLM budget. Frontend connectivity issues, stemming from incorrect URL configuration and missing proxy, were debugged and resolved, restoring real-time data display and interactive UI. Significant effort was then directed towards establishing full BingX account control, which involved fixing API call structures, whitelisting the server IP, and correcting data parsing to finally identify user funds in the Futures account. The latest enhancements include integrating a sophisticated 5-level dynamic take-profit strategy and a dynamic leverage system based on Claude's confidence and real-time crypto market sentiment. The work consistently addressed both backend logic and frontend user experience, culminating in a highly functional and production-ready application.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to build a sophisticated Dual AI Trading Bot with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. It features a scout for opportunities, IA1 for technical analysis (GPT-4o), and IA2 for strategic decisions (Claude-3-7-Sonnet). The system integrates real market data from 8+ APIs with multi-threaded fallback, pre-filters opportunities using a  for patterns and trends from real OHLCV data. JSON serialization errors are fixed, and frontend connectivity (, ) is established. The bot now includes multi-level take-profit strategies, automatic position inversion, and intelligent API economy optimization to filter low-quality data before LLM calls. Recent enhancements include a robust historical data fallback, dynamic leverage and SL/TP based on market sentiment and IA2 confidence, and full BingX Futures account control, enabling trade execution and real-time balance display. The user also requested granular control over AI credit consumption via Start/Stop trading buttons.

<current_work>
The system has been significantly enhanced into an Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot. The historical data fallback system is robust, collecting 100+ days of OHLCV data from multi-sources (Binance, CoinGecko, CryptoCompare, Kraken, Messari, Glassnode). IA1 (GPT-4o) performs detailed technical analysis using correct indicators. IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet) now receives IA1 analyses, generates decisions, and its LLM calls are functional after fixing budget and f-string errors.

Frontend connectivity issues (incorrect URLs, missing proxy, WebSocket misconfigurations) are resolved, providing a fully functional dashboard with real-time data and clickable tabs accessible both locally and via an external preview URL. Crucially, full BingX Futures account control is established: the app can now correctly connect, authenticate, whitelist IP, and accurately read the user's funds (USDT 3.45, USDC .79) from the Futures account after resolving parsing errors.

The latest major features implemented are a 5-level strategic take-profit system and a dynamic leverage calculation. The Claude prompt has been updated to consider market sentiment (Total Market Cap, BTC Dominance, BTC 24h Change) and IA2 confidence to dynamically adjust leverage (2x-10x) and optimize stop-loss/take-profit levels. The  has been refactored for robustness, ensuring opportunities are stored and the IA1-IA2 flow is efficient. The Start/Stop trading buttons also fully control AI credit consumption.
