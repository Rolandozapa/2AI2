The trajectory details the iterative development of an Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot. Initially, the AI refined IA2's Take Profit (TP) system, transitioning from fixed to dynamic, probabilistically calibrated levels. This was followed by implementing a comprehensive active trading and position management system, including risk-based sizing and a 3% trailing stop. A significant effort was then dedicated to repository cleanup and resolving critical bugs, notably a conflict in IA2's decision logic between Multi-RR and a fallback filter, and later, mathematical errors in newly implemented chart patterns. The AI extensively enhanced the chart pattern detection and its integration with IA1's interpretation. Finally, the AI proposed and began implementing an Adaptive Context System for dynamic strategy adjustment and initiated the development of a backtesting engine using provided historical data. The development consistently involved iterative debugging, user clarifications, and systematic code modifications across both backend and frontend.

The overarching goal is to develop an Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, integrating GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic decisions, controlling BingX Futures with features like dynamic TP/SL, position inversion, dynamic leverage, and AI credit control.

Key enhancements requested and implemented include:
-   **Probabilistic Optimal TP System**: IA2 (Claude) generates custom Take Profit levels with probabilistic distributions (e.g., TP1: 35%, TP2: 40%, TP3: 25%) specifically when recommending LONG or SHORT positions.
-   **Active Trading Execution & Position Management**: Implementation of an open trade function, real-time monitoring of current trading positions with risk-based sizing (e.g., 2% account risk per trade), and a dynamic inbound trailing Stop Loss (SL) of 3% activated after TP1 is hit.
-   **Comprehensive Chartist Pattern Recognition**: Expanding the number and sophistication of detected chart patterns (Triangles, Consolidations, Triple Top/Bottom, Rounding, Harmonic, Volatility patterns like Gartley, Bat, Butterfly, Diamond, Wedges, Double Bottom, Head and Shoulders) and ensuring their effective integration into IA1's analysis and frontend display.
-   **IA2 Decision Logic Prioritization**: Prioritizing IA2's recommendations over the Multi-RR engine when IA2's confidence exceeds 80% to resolve conflicts (e.g., IA2 recommending SHORT vs. fallback IA2 forcing HOLD due to low RR).
-   **Adaptive Context System**: Implementation of an AI-recommended Adaptive Context System to dynamically adjust trading strategy based on real-time market conditions.
-   **Repository Cleanup**: Refactoring the codebase to keep only essential files for maintainability.
-   **Backtesting Engine**: Development of a system to backtest the trading logic using historical market data.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was working on implementing a **Backtesting Engine**. The user provided historical data, which the AI successfully downloaded and extracted. The AI then created a new backend file  to house the backtesting logic and added a corresponding API endpoint in .

The current focus is on the **frontend integration for the backtesting engine**. The AI has started modifying  to:
1.  Add a new tab for Backtesting in the navigation.
2.  Add functions within  to handle backtesting data and API calls.

The trajectory ended as the AI was in the process of adding the backtesting tab to the navigation (). This indicates that the backend for backtesting is structurally ready, and the remaining work involves completing the frontend UI and functionality to interact with it.
