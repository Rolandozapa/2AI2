The AI engineer's trajectory shows an iterative development process for an Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot. It began with downloading and extracting historical data. The AI then focused on building a comprehensive AI training and performance enhancement system. This involved creating new backend modules (, , , , , ) and integrating them into .

A circular import issue was resolved by refactoring data models into . Frontend integration for a new Backtesting tab and AI training controls in  was a continuous effort, including fixing a critical JSX syntax error. The user explicitly requested to enhance the AI training with more chart patterns, leading to the integration of over 30 patterns, and then with technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands). The last interaction concluded with the AI preparing to update IA1 and IA2 prompts to leverage these newly integrated indicators.

The goal is to develop an Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot using React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. It integrates GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic decisions, controlling BingX Futures. Key functionalities include:
- **Probabilistic Optimal TP System**: IA2 generates dynamic Take Profit levels with probabilistic distributions for LONG/SHORT positions.
- **Active Trading & Position Management**: Real-time trade execution, risk-based sizing, and dynamic 3% trailing Stop Loss after TP1 hit.
- **Comprehensive Chartist Pattern Recognition**: Detection of various chart patterns (Triangles, Harmonic, Volatility, etc.) for IA1 analysis and frontend display. Initially 12, then expanded to 32+ patterns.
- **IA2 Decision Logic Prioritization**: IA2 recommendations override Multi-RR if confidence > 80%.
- **Adaptive Context System**: Dynamically adjusts strategy based on market conditions, enhanced by historical data.
- **Backtesting Engine**: Evaluate trading logic with historical data.
- **AI Model Training/Fine-tuning**: Use historical data to improve IA1/IA2 accuracy, enhance pattern detection, and train for market condition classification, initially with chart patterns and subsequently with RSI, MACD, Stochastic, and Bollinger Bands.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully integrated advanced technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, and Bollinger Bands) into the AI training system. This involved creating a new file  to encapsulate the calculation logic for these indicators. The  method within  was updated to utilize this new module and incorporate these indicators into the historical data processing for training. The  was updated to include necessary libraries like , and the backend services were restarted to apply these changes. The final task in progress is to **optimize the IA1 and IA2 prompts** within  to leverage these newly integrated technical indicators. This aims to significantly enhance the accuracy of IA1's technical analysis and IA2's strategic decision-making by providing them with richer, more comprehensive market data inputs.
