The AI engineer successfully addressed numerous critical bugs and implemented sophisticated features for the Dual AI Trading Bot. Initial efforts focused on fixing IA1/IA2 backend issues, including an infinite recursion in the scoring formula and  errors. A major challenge was stabilizing the server from CPU saturation, which involved removing duplicated methods and safeguarding the  loop by protecting . Significant work was dedicated to ensuring accurate Risk-Reward (RR) calculation: first for IA1 (correcting entry/stop/take-profit price assignment and linking RR to these prices, not just technical levels), and then for IA2, where the primary issue was a disconnect between IA2's internal RR calculation using technical levels and the final stored trade decision's adjusted prices. This was resolved by calculating IA2's RR *after* all price adjustments, using the final , , and  values with the correct LONG/SHORT formula. The system is now stable and all core trading logic, including precise RR calculation, is validated. The latest task involves integrating with the BingX API.

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot is a full-stack application (React, FastAPI, MongoDB) leveraging GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic trading on BingX Futures. The goal is automated, sophisticated trading decisions. Key features include: a dual AI pipeline (IA1 confidence >70% or RR >=2.0 feeds IA2 confidence >80%), comprehensive technical analysis by IA1, an adaptive context system for dynamic strategy, dynamic Risk-Reward (IA1 calculates RR, IA2 recalculates with its own levels), multi-timeframe chartist maturity, sophisticated final scoring for IA1 confidence, and an untruncated frontend display. The system has evolved through numerous fixes, including accurate IA1 price and RR calculation, a stable backend, and IA2 precisely calculating RR based on final trade prices.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer successfully resolved a critical issue where IA2's calculated Risk-Reward (RR) did not match the actual trade's  and  values. The problem stemmed from IA2 calculating RR using theoretical technical levels, while the final  object used adjusted prices (e.g., for leverage, multi-TP). This led to a mismatch, displaying an incorrect RR in the UI.

The final fix involved strategically moving the RR calculation within  to occur *after* all final trade prices (, , ) were determined in the IA2 decision logic. This ensures that the RR is calculated using the precise prices that would be used for actual trading. The appropriate LONG or SHORT RR formula is applied automatically based on IA2's final signal. This was validated by manually checking a TIAUSDT SHORT trade, where the displayed RR () precisely matched the calculation based on its entry, stop-loss, and take-profit prices, confirming perfect accuracy and coherence.

Following this, the user requested to proceed with BingX API integration. The AI engineer initiated the process by analyzing the BingX API documentation to understand the required endpoints, authentication (HMAC-SHA256), and functionalities like order placement, position management, and trailing stops.
