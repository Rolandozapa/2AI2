The trajectory details the AI engineer's work on the Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot. The initial task was to analyze the IA1 to IA2 filtering logic. This quickly evolved into a series of feature enhancements and critical bug fixes. Key development points included implementing IA1-driven, technically-grounded Risk-Reward (RR) calculation, refining IA1's recommendation logic, integrating advanced market phase-based conditional bonuses, and ensuring IA2 leverages IA1's enriched historical context.

Significant debugging efforts were required to address issues such as:  complexities,  in the database,  method signature mismatches,  errors during analysis processing, persistent system overload due to a duplicate exception handler, and IA1 analysis truncation. The AI engineer systematically identified and resolved these, restarting services and testing frequently. The system now functions, generates analyses, and processes decisions, with the current focus on why IA1 analyses are not displayed in the frontend, despite backend processing.

The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot is a full-stack application leveraging React, FastAPI, and MongoDB. It integrates GPT-4o (IA1) for detailed technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic trading decisions on BingX Futures. The core problem it solves is automating sophisticated trading decisions based on comprehensive market data and AI insights.

Key requirements include:
-   **Dual AI Decision Flow**: IA1 performs technical analysis (requiring >70% confidence and initially RR >2) and feeds its insights to IA2 for strategic review and potential trade execution (requiring >80% confidence).
-   **Comprehensive Technical Analysis**: IA1 must incorporate chart patterns, RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, and Fibonacci retracement.
-   **Adaptive Context System**: The system dynamically adjusts strategies based on current market conditions and historical data.
-   **Backtesting Engine**: For evaluating trading logic.
-   **AI Model Training**: To fine-tune IA1/IA2 with historical data, identifying successful patterns and market conditions.
-   **Dynamic Risk-Reward (RR)**: IA1 is responsible for calculating a realistic RR based on market conditions, specific crypto volatility, technical indicators, and support/resistance levels.
-   **Conditional Filtering**: IA1 analyses are passed to IA2 if they exhibit a LONG/SHORT signal with >70% confidence OR if their calculated RR is >= 2.0.
-   **Historical Context**: IA1 should leverage extensive historical data (price trends, swing highs/lows, volatility, volume behavior) for more informed analysis.
-   **Market Phase-based Bonuses**: Apply performance enhancements and position sizing adjustments only when the current market phase aligns with historically favorable conditions for a given strategy/pattern.
-   **Frontend Display**: All AI analyses and decisions should be fully visible in the UI without truncation.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **FastAPI**: Python framework for backend API development.
-   **React**: JavaScript library for building the frontend user interface.
-   **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for data storage, using UUIDs for IDs.
-   **LLMs**: GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic decision-making.
-   **Technical Analysis**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Stochastic, Fibonacci Retracement, Chart Patterns, Support/Resistance Levels.
-   ** & **: For data manipulation and numerical operations in indicator calculations.
-   ****: Asynchronous programming for efficient I/O operations in the backend.
-   ****: An abstraction layer for LLM API calls, used to interact with GPT-4o and Claude.
-   **Market Phase Detection**: Classification of market conditions (e.g., Accumulation, Bull Run, Distribution, Bear Market).

-   Currently, the IA1 Analysis tab in the frontend displays No technical analyses available, despite the dashboard indicating 10 analyses and backend logs showing analyses are generated and stored.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in reconnecting the frontend and debugging any remaining issues after numerous backend changes. This involved restarting both frontend and backend services multiple times to apply the latest code. During this process, a critical Python syntax error was discovered in  (non-default argument follows default argument in  dataclass), which prevented the backend from starting correctly. This was fixed, and the backend restarted successfully.

After fixing the backend startup issue and reactivating the trading system, the frontend successfully reconnected, showing active opportunities, IA1 analyses (10), and IA2 decisions (17) in the dashboard. However, when navigating to the IA1 Analysis tab, it explicitly stated No technical analyses available. This indicates a data retrieval or display issue specific to the IA1 Analysis tab, despite the data being present and counted on the dashboard. The last action was the user asking Pourquoi IA1 est vide mon fr√®re de titane and the AI engineer confirming the problem and planning to investigate the frontend-backend API communication for the IA1 analysis display.

<optional_next_step>
Investigate why the IA1 Analysis tab is empty in the frontend by checking the API call and frontend rendering logic.
