<analysis>
The AI engineer successfully developed the Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot, integrating complex features. Initial work focused on backend AI training systems, resolving circular imports, and fixing frontend JSX errors. Key enhancements involved integrating advanced technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands) and Fibonacci retracement, then optimizing IA1/IA2 prompts to leverage these. Significant effort was spent debugging the Stochastic indicator's display and fixing a critical frontend API routing issue by correctly adding the  prefix to all calls. The system now dynamically selects optimal Take Profit levels for IA2's Risk-Reward calculation and handles multiple chart patterns. The last ongoing task is to analyze the IA1 to IA2 filtering logic.

<product_requirements>
The Ultra Professional Edition Dual AI Trading Bot aims to use React, FastAPI, and MongoDB, integrating GPT-4o (IA1) for technical analysis and Claude-3-7-Sonnet (IA2) for strategic decisions on BingX Futures. Key requirements include:
- **Dual AI Decision Flow**: IA1 (technical analysis, >70% confidence, RR >2) feeds IA2 (strategic review, >80% confidence for trade execution).
- **Comprehensive Technical Analysis**: Incorporate various chart patterns (expanded to 32+), RSI, MACD, Stochastic, Bollinger Bands, and Fibonacci retracement for IA1.
- **Adaptive Context System**: Dynamically adjust strategy based on market conditions using historical data.
- **Backtesting Engine**: Evaluate trading logic.
- **AI Model Training**: Fine-tune IA1/IA2 with historical data.
- **Dynamic Risk-Reward (RR)**: IA2 must calculate a realistic, re-actualized RR based on its optimized Entry, Stop Loss, and dynamic Take Profit (TP) levels (TP1, TP2, TP3) determined by market conditions (volatility, confidence).

    -   **Importance**: Displays real-time data from the backend, handles API calls, and provides user interaction.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   Fixed a critical API routing issue by ensuring all backend calls correctly prepend  to .
        -   Implemented rendering for IA1 Analysis, IA2 Decisions, and Active Positions tabs, which were previously empty.
        -   Increased character limits for IA1 (from 300 to 800) and IA2 (from 400 to 1000) reasoning in the UI.
        -   Corrected IA2 reasoning display from  to .
        -   Added a new column for Fibonacci retracement levels in the IA1 analysis vignettes.
        -   Added a new column for IA2's calculated Risk-Reward ratio in the IA2 decisions vignettes, with dynamic color coding (Red for low, Yellow for good, Green for excellent).
        -   Added default values for Fibonacci fields to prevent frontend errors with old analyses.

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was engaged in analyzing the strategic decision-making process within the application, specifically focusing on how IA1 analyses are filtered and passed to IA2 for further review. The user asked for clarification on quel methode fais que lanalyse technique IA1 est envoye a IA2, quel sont ces filtres ?. The AI engineer identified the  method in  (around line 5677) as the key function responsible for this filtering. The current work involves a detailed examination of this function to understand its criteria and logic. This is crucial for ensuring that the dual-AI system operates effectively, passing only high-quality, relevant opportunities from IA1's technical analysis to IA2's strategic decision engine.
