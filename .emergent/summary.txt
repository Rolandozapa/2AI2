The trajectory details the refinement of a Dual AI Trading Bot, transitioning it to an Ultra Professional Edition. Initially, the focus was on fixing IA1 deduplication and display issues, followed by a major effort to unblock the Scout’s restrictive filters, particularly the lateral movement detection, which was permanently removed after extensive debugging. A key architectural shift involved optimizing IA1-IA2 interaction, first by implementing an IA1 confidence-based filter for IA2, then by explicitly ensuring IA2 receives and prioritizes IA1’s full reasoning and MASTER PATTERN strategic choice to resolve contradictions. Realistic Take Profit levels were implemented, and an Intelligent TP Settler was introduced, eventually shifting its logic to be handled by Claude (IA2) via prompt. Persistent issues with micro-priced tokens like BabyDogeUSDT led to a deep dive into technical indicator calculation and support/resistance rounding, ensuring accurate data handling. Finally, a robust multi-API fallback system for market data was implemented, and the agent began integrating a BingX-specific tradable symbols filter to optimize the Scout process.

<product_requirements>
The objective is to build a sophisticated Dual AI Trading Bot with React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB. The system uses a market scout, IA1 (GPT-4o) for technical analysis, and IA2 (Claude-3-7-Sonnet) for strategic decisions, integrating real market data from multiple APIs. Key features include multi-level take-profit strategies, automatic position inversion, dynamic leverage, BingX Futures account control, and granular AI credit consumption control.

Recent enhancements and fixes include:
- Implementing robust historical data fallback.
- Fixing IA1-IA2 data flow and LLM budget issues through refined deduplication and confidence-based filtering.
- Establishing full BingX account control.
- Integrating a 5-level dynamic take-profit strategy and leverage-proportional trailing stop-loss.
- Setting application timestamps to Paris time.
- Optimizing scout cycle frequency to 4 hours.
- Implementing and refining Risk-Reward (R:R) filters (min 2:1 for IA1, then pre-filter in Scout) to save LLM credits, and correcting R:R calculation consistency.
- Implementing comprehensive deduplication across opportunities, IA1 analyses, and IA2 decisions, moving checks before LLM calls.
- Relaxing scout filters (R:R, lateral movement, volume) to increase opportunity pass rate, eventually leading to the permanent removal of the restrictive lateral movement filter.
- Optimizing IA1 to recommend HOLD for uninteresting cryptos, filtering these before IA2.
- Refining IA1-IA2 communication to ensure IA2 prioritizes IA1's strategic choice and full reasoning, including a MASTER PATTERN designation.
- Adjusting Take Profit levels to be more realistic (TP1 at 0.5%) and implementing an Intelligent TP Settler concept, evolved to be handled by IA2 through prompt engineering.
- Resolving technical indicator calculation issues for micro-priced tokens to ensure accurate analysis and confidence scoring.
- Implementing an Ultra-Robust Market Aggregator with 10+ external APIs for reliable data sourcing.
- Integrating a filter to ensure the scout only analyzes tokens tradable on BingX.

<code_architecture>



-   : Main FastAPI entry point and orchestrator, housing the  class.
    -   **Importance**: Coordinates AI analysis, market data, trading, WebSockets, and manages the entire trading cycle. It's the central hub.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   IA1 deduplication logic moved before LLM calls.
        -   Deduplication added to  endpoint and Paris timezone consistency ensured.
        -   Scout filters (R:R, lateral movement, volume) were extensively modified and eventually the lateral movement filter was permanently removed.
        -   IA1's prompt and  model updated to include  (HOLD/LONG/SHORT).
        -    now filters based on IA1 confidence (>=70%).
        -   Claude (IA2) override logic implemented to prioritize its decisions when highly confident (Hierarchie Clara).
        -   IA2 prompt updated with realistic Take Profit levels (TP1 0.5%, TP2 1.0%, etc.) and later evolved to include  managed by Claude.
        -   IA1-IA2 communication enhanced to send full IA1 reasoning and a MASTER PATTERN designation to IA2.
        -   IA1's RR calculation corrected to use Master Pattern targets, and RR is displayed in reports.
        -   , , ,  were updated to handle micro-priced tokens accurately (e.g., using  for RSI,  for S/R).
        -   References to the old  replaced with .
        -   Integration of  import and filtering logic added to the Scout.
-   : Environment variables.
    -   **Importance**: Stores API keys and database connection string.
    -   **Changes Made**: Updated with new API keys for CoinMarketCap, CoinAPI, TwelveData, Binance.
-   : Pre-filters opportunities by detecting chart patterns.
    -   **Importance**: Filters low-quality opportunities before costly AI analysis.
    -   **Changes Made**: No direct explicit changes to its core logic, but its output is now heavily relied upon by IA1's MASTER PATTERN logic, and its integration within the scout's  function has changed.
-   : Aggregates market data from various sources.
    -   **Importance**: Provides reliable, multi-source market data for the trading system.
    -   **Changes Made**: Replaced with  to incorporate 10+ external APIs with robust fallback mechanisms.
-   : *New file created*.
    -   **Importance**: Fetches and filters a list of tradable futures symbols from BingX to ensure the bot only processes relevant opportunities.
    -   **Changes Made**: Contains the  class, as provided by the user.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of integrating a BingX-specific tradable symbols filter into the Scout. This involves using the  class, recently created in , to obtain an up-to-date list of symbols available for trading on BingX.

The work completed immediately before this summary request includes:
1.  **Creation of **: A new file was created containing the  class, which handles fetching, filtering (by quote currency, keywords, and status), caching, and loading BingX tradable symbols.
2.  **Import in **: The  has been successfully imported into .
3.  **Integration of Filter in Scout**: The actual filtering logic has been added to the  method in . This filter checks if an  is present in the  list *before* proceeding with costly R:R calculations, optimizing resource usage.

The immediate next step, which was in progress, is to ensure that the  is initialized and its  method is called at application startup to populate the  list. The trajectory ended while searching for an appropriate initialization section in .
